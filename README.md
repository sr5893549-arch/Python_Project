Password Tool - Simple Python Password Generator & Strength Checker

A lightweight, beginner-friendly Python script that helps you:

1. Generate secure random passwords (12 characters by default)
2. Guarantees at least one lowercase, uppercase, number, and special character
3. Randomly shuffles the result for better entropy
4. Check the strength of any password you enter
Features:
1. Menu-driven interface
2. Fast and no external dependencies (only uses built-in random)
3. Basic strength scoring based on length and character variety
   
 Great for learning Python basics, practicing with random, loops, conditionals, and string handling.
 Perfect as a simple utility script or teaching example.
